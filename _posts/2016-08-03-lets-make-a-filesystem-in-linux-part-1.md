Before you continue, the following post series assumes that you have some prior knowledge. Here are my assumptions about you, dear reader:

1. You can read and write C code proficiently.
2. You understand some basic things about operating systems (you have rough abstractions in your brain, about how the OS virtualizes hardware resources).
3. You have some familiarity with the Linux operating system.
4. You are interested in this topic.
